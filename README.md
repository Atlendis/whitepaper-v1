# Atlendis protocol V1

This repository hosts the Atlendis protocol V1's whitepaper. The goal of this document is to provide a detailed and technical description of how the protocol works under the hood.

This is a static document that explains how the protocol behaves today and doesn't describe the features that we are planning on tackling later in our roadmap. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach us out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AtlendisLabs) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/DPPNH8Nc)!
