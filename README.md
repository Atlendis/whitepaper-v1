# Atlendis protocol V1

This repository hosts Atlendis protocol V1's whitepaper.  

Atlendis is a decentralized non-custodial and capital-efficient DeFi lending protocol that allows liquidity providers (LPs) to lend digital assets to whitelisted counterparties. The protocol is composed of a set of fully autonomous smart contracts that reside on the Ethereum network. As opposed to other lending protocols that require the borrower to deposit collateral, Atlendis enables whitelisted borrowers to borrow without posting any collateral upfront. The unsecured nature of the loan exposes the lender to credit risk that is rewarded with a yield determined by the market's supply/demand dynamics.
